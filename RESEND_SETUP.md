# 📧 Resend Email Integration Setup

## 🚀 Quick Setup Guide

### 1. Get Your Resend API Key

1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com) and create a free account
2. Navigate to **API Keys** in your dashboard
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Copy your API key (starts with `re_`)

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```bash
# Resend API Configuration
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key_here

# Email Configuration
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
AUDIENCE_ID=your_audience_id_here
```

### 3. Domain Setup (Important!)

**For production emails to work properly:**

1. **Add your domain** in Resend dashboard
2. **Verify DNS records** (Resend will provide the records)
3. **Update FROM_EMAIL** to use your verified domain

**For testing:** You can use Resend's default domain, but emails might go to spam.

### 4. Create an Audience (Optional but Recommended)

1. In Resend dashboard, go to **Audiences**
2. Click **Create Audience**
3. Copy the Audience ID to your `.env.local`

This allows you to manage subscribers and send newsletters later.
